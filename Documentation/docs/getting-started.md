# Installation

This project uses a few external libraries:

-   **Easy Save 3 (ES3):** Used as the main saving and loading system.
    
-   **Newtonsoft.Json:** Handles JSON serialization and deserialization.
    
-   **Odin Inspector:** Used in a limited way to improve the editor experience.
    

These dependencies are required for the project to work as expected.
